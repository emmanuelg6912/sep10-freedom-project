## Part A: existing technology

* Searched up **"Animal Conservation Technology Apps"** 
* I found an app called **"Earth Ranger"** which uses data from different animals, habitats, and environments to help in protecting and conserving wildlife.
   * There's also different parts of the website such as the ecoscope which is a free open source model used for making analytics on animal populations and their time spent in specific areas.
   *  Different parts of the website are organized and specific.
   *  Available on all ios/android/computers and it's free. 
   * [heres the link to the app](https://www.earthranger.com/)

* The next app I found was named **"eBird"** which was a very interesting online website app where different users can take pictures and share data of the birds they find.
  * With users being able to share all this information scientists are able to get a better understanding and data on the locations of birds, their populations, and their species. This in return can provide newer opportunities for developments in animal conservation in the future and beyond.
  * You only need to make an account to get started.
  * accessible on all platforms/ios/android/computer for free.
  * A video on the website talks about the app and its purpose.

* The Final app that I ended up finding was called  **"wild track"** which uses data analytics, artificial intelligence, and ecological knowledge to help in conserving wildlife.
  * Uses a new app named FIT/Footprint Identification Technology which allows for easy tracking and data of animal population by just taking     a picture of an animal's footprint.
  * Uses non invasive methods that do not disturb or bother animals or species.
  * Technology is accessible to all communities.
  * download the app on ios or android for free.
  * [heres the link to the app](https://www.wildtrack.org/)
