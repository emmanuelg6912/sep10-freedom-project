## Part A: existing technology
* Searched up **"animal conservation technology apps"** 
  * I found a app called **Earth Ranger** which uses data from different animals, habitats, and enviorments to help in protecting and conserving wildlife
  * [heres the link to the app](https://www.earthranger.com/)

* The next app I found was named ebird which was a very interesting online website app where different users can take pictures and share data of the birds they find.
  * With users being able to share this information scientists are able to get a better understanding and data on the locations of birds, their populations, and their species. This in return can provide newer opportunities for developments in animal conservation in the future and beyond.

* Searched up **"animal technology apps"**
    * did not find any results
* Searched up **"animal data apps"**
    * did not find any results
* **honorable mention**
    * I found a app named **grameners** which although does not specialize in using animal conservation technologies, AI can be used in compiling pieces of data and information in the form of percentages, images, and, graphs. This in return can be used in animal conservation to calculate animal populations, endangered species, and more important pieces of information that can help in developing animal conservation technologies.
