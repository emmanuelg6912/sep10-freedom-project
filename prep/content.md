* Searched up **"animal technology apps"**
 * did not find any results
* Searched up **"animal data apps"**
 * did not find any results
* **honorable mention**
 * I found a app named **grameners** which although does not specialize in using animal conservation technologies, AI can be used in compiling pieces of data and information in the form of percentages, images, and, graphs. This in return can be used in animal conservation to calculate animal populations, endangered species, and more important pieces of information that can help in developing animal conservation technologies. 

## Part B: possible future technology
