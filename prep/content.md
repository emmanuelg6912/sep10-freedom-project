## Part A: existing technology

* Searched up **"Animal Conservation Technology Apps"** 
* I found an app called **"Earth Ranger"** which uses data from different animals, habitats, and environments to help in protecting and conserving wildlife.
   * There's also different parts of the website such as the ecoscope which is a free open source model used for making analytics on animal populations and their times spent in specific areas.
   *  Different parts of the website are organized and specific.
   *  Available on all ios/android/computer and it's free. 
   * [heres the link to the app](https://www.earthranger.com/)

* The next app I found was named **"eBird"** which was a very interesting online website app where different users can take pictures and share data of the birds they find.
  * With users being able to share all this information scientists are able to get a better understanding and data on the locations of birds, their populations, and their species. This in return can provide newer opportunities for developments in animal conservation in the future and beyond.
  * You only need to make an account to get started.
  * accessible on all platforms/ios/android/computer for free.
  * A video in the website talks about the app and its purpose.

* Searched up **"Animal Technology Apps"**
    * did not find any results.
* Searched up **"Animal Data Apps"**
    * did not find any results.
* **Honorable Mention**
    * I found an app named **"Gramener"** which although does not specialize in using animal conservation technologies it can be used in compiling pieces of data and information in the form of percentages, images, and graphs. This in return can be used in animal conservation to calculate animal populations, endangered species, and more important pieces of information that can help in developing Animal Conservation technologies.
