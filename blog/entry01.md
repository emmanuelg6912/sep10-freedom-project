# Entry 1: The topic of animal conservation 
##### 10/6/25

### Why I chose animal conservation 

The topic I decided to choose animal conservation because it feels like one of those passions that ive never been able to fully research and to learn about. But now that I have that opportunity with the freedom project im starting to be more interested in this topic and I have started to research about the topic and its technology. I first had inspiration when I first learned about these different foundations and animal conservations across the world. The one that caught my eye as a kid was a conservation in which orphan orangutans were taught in basically full on schools on how to survive within wildlife without parental guidence. I was at first surprised that something like that actually exists within conservation and I feel like that now with technology development these different foundations and forms of conservation can grow and develop into something even better. 

### Sources that I found 

One main link that was the most interesting with the website being called ["wwf"](https://www.wwf.org.uk/project/conservationtechnology) and this is because it contained all the important information on the technological advancments that are being made towards animal conservation. I also noticed that from the website there were many different links to different technologies being made towards animal conservation such as ["camera trapping"](https://www.wwf.org.uk/project/conservationtechnology/camera-trap) which focuses on being able to detect any animals or predators that may be encountered throughout wildlife. [Acoustic monitoring](https://www.wwf.org.uk/project/conservationtechnology/acoustic-monitoring) focuses on providing data on population density within a species, human disturbance, and other possible pieces of data that may impact wildlife. And lastly, ["lidar sensing"](https://www.wwf.org.uk/project/conservationtechnology/lidar) focuses on using light as a way to form 3d models of natural forests using a drone to scan out wildlife areas and gain information on landscapes and different areas that animals may be in. I also found another source called ["the Marine Mammal Center"](https://www.marinemammalcenter.org/news/conservation-technology-5-innovations-in-ocean-health) which has more of a focus on conservation and prottection of marine mammals such as seals who are often sedated and tangled in plastic and also using specific technologies to help in tracking the population of marine mammals.   

### Engineering Design Process 
I am currently at the first step of the engineering design project because although I have the sets of information on the topic I feel like I need to dive more deeper into this  concept and be able to talk with other people and students who may have a different perspective and different Ideas. Right now im trying to be able to identify the problem by being able to get more information from different people and what understandings can I gain from communication.

### Skills 

Some skills that I have learned from working on this blog is **organization**, **time management**, and **consideration**

#### organization
Organization was an important skill to me as it helps in making me prepare and it can help me in being able to organize the information that I might gain during this topic. At first my organization was more simple as I would organize things by folders which although was reliable it did not help in managing specific workloads and keeping all my information organize. So I would often use different apps that organize my scedule, my files, and folders that can help in making my workflow and research more efficient. 

#### time management
I often have a large workflow due to some of the activities that I like to do at home such as playing video games, and watching different forms of social media. However distractions were a large reason that I often would need to complete alot of work in one sitting such as loud noises from outside, family members talking, and my brother who always plays sports indoors. However i've found a solution to this problem and that is using headphones. Headphones help in canceling out those loud noises and playing calming music helped in keeping myself focused and free of distractions. And I have also decided to cut back on those distracting activities and give myself a balance between diligence and relaxation. 

#### consideration 
Consideration was another skill I have developed because now I have become more aware of what pros and cons a situation may bring and also being able to understand the positive affects and the negative affects that animal conservation may bring. I have noticed that within animal conservation the cost of all these different technologies can be really pricey. This in return can negatively impact different organizations that are trying to use these different technologies to help in animal conservation. With this skill I can observe and analyse more on different resources and it can teach me to think first about my actions and the consqeuences they may bring. 

### Next steps 

I hope that these skills and all these different forms of information that ive gained will help in researching different innovations and technology within animal conservation!
