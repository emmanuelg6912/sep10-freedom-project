### Why I chose animal conservation 

The topic I decided to choose animal conservation because it feels like one of those passions that ive never been able to fully research and to learn about. But now that I have that opportunity with the freedom project im starting to be more interested in this topic and I have started to research about the topic and its technology. I first had an inspiration when I first learned about these different foundations and animal conservations across the world. The one that caught my eye as a kid was a conservation in which orphan orangutans were taught in basically full on schools on how to survive within wildlife without parental guidence. I was at first surprised that something like that actually exists within conservation and I feel like that now with technology development these different foundations and forms of conservation can grow and develop into something even better.

One main link that was the most interesting with the website being called  (https://www.wwf.org.uk/project/conservationtechnology)["wwf.org.uk"] and this is because it contained all the important information on the technological advancments that are being made towards animal conservation. I also noticed that from the website there were many different links to different technologies being made towards animal conservation such as (https://www.wwf.org.uk/project/conservationtechnology/camera-trap)[cameratrapping]                    [acoustic monitoring](https://www.wwf.org.uk/project/conservationtechnology/acoustic-monitoring)
