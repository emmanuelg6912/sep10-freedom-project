# Entry 1: The topic of animal conservation 
##### 10/6/25

### Why I chose animal conservation 

The topic I decided to choose animal conservation because it feels like one of those passions that ive never been able to fully research and to learn about. But now that I have that opportunity with the freedom project im starting to be more interested in this topic and I have started to research about the topic and its technology. I first had an inspiration when I first learned about these different foundations and animal conservations across the world. The one that caught my eye as a kid was a conservation in which orphan orangutans were taught in basically full on schools on how to survive within wildlife without parental guidence. I was at first surprised that something like that actually exists within conservation and I feel like that now with technology development these different foundations and forms of conservation can grow and develop into something even better. 

### Sources that I found 

One main link that was the most interesting with the website being called ["wwf.org.uk"](https://www.wwf.org.uk/project/conservationtechnology) and this is because it contained all the important information on the technological advancments that are being made towards animal conservation. I also noticed that from the website there were many different links to different technologies being made towards animal conservation such as [cameratrapping](https://www.wwf.org.uk/project/conservationtechnology/camera-trap) which focuses on being able to detect any animals or predators that may be encountered throughout wildlife. [Acoustic monitoring](https://www.wwf.org.uk/project/conservationtechnology/acoustic-monitoring) focuses on providing data on population density within a species, human disturbance, and other possible pieces of data that may impact wildlife. And lastly, [lidar sensing](https://www.wwf.org.uk/project/conservationtechnology/lidar) which focuses on using light as a way to form 3d models of natural forests using a drone to scan out wildlife areas and gain information on the landscape and different areas that animals may be in. I also used another source called [the Marine Mammal Center](https://www.marinemammalcenter.org/news/conservation-technology-5-innovations-in-ocean-health) which has more of a focus on conservation and prottection of marine mammals such as seals who are often sedated and tangled in plastic and also using specific technologies to help in tracking the population of marine mammals.   

### Engineering Design Process 
I am currently at the second step of the engineering design project because right now I have the informaation
